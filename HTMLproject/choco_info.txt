Dark chocolate, also known as "plain chocolate", is produced using a 
higher percentage of cocoa with all fat content coming from cocoa butter 
instead of milk, but there are also "dark milk" chocolates and many degrees 
of hybrids. Dark chocolate can be eaten as is, or used in cooking, for which 
thicker baking bars, usually with high cocoa percentages ranging from 70% to 
100%, are sold. Baking chocolates containing no added sugar may be labeled 
"unsweetened chocolate".
